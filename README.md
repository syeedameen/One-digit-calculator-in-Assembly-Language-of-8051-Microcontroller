# Journey-with-Assembley-language
My semester project of "Computer Organization and assembly language" course. (Third semester of my BSCS (sep 2018 to jan 2019)).
I code this "one digit calculator" program in 8051 assembly language and my other group mates made the hardware implementation.
I really got much tough time when I was stuck with initializing the LCD and then comes the blinking of cursor and then displaying the digits along with considering the time interval to send one digit to screen. Then giving the final touch by using microprocessor's stack to store the integers and then computing the results and then showing the results on screen by sending the digits of the results one by one to the LCD.
Alhamdulilah, after completion of this project I was so much happy.
